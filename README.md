# CSC251Project
 Repository for hosting the CSC251 Programming Project.
 A programming project from my Advanced Java Programming Course. This project takes a text file containing customer information, and calculates insurance rates based on several health factors. This information is then stored into a class array with a print function to clearly print the information in an organized manner.
